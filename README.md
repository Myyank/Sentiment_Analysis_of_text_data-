# Sentiment_Analysis_of_text_data-

This code repo was build as a part of the kaggle competition based on text classification. The goal of this project is to implement and train classification algorithms
on a corpus of 1 millions texts which are annotated as negative, positive and neutral. 


The Notebooks requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, keras and sklearn libraries to run.

The train data(train.csv),train results(train_results.csv) and test data(test.csv) must be present in same directory as notebook files.

After this you can run the Jupyter notebook.

A test_result.csv file would be generated that can be uploaded to the Kaggle Competition.
